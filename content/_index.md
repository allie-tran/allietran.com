I am currently an Postdoctoral Researcher at Adapt Centre, School of Computing, Dublin City University, Ireland. My research interests include multimodal retrieval, natural language processing, especially question answering, some human-computer interaction and data visualisation. At the moment, I am working on the KatoAI, which is an Enterprise Ireland funded commercialisation project that aims to develop a tool for teachers to create, manage and deliver digital content in the classroom.

Outside of research, I am also a digital artist with a passion for animation and concept art. I enjoy exploring visual storytelling and creative expression through illustration and design.
