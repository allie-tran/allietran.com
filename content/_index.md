I am currently an Postdoctoral Researcher at Adapt Centre, School of Computing, Dublin City University, Ireland. My research interests include multimodal retrieval, natural language processing, especially question answering, some human-computer interaction and data visualisation. At the moment, I am working on SelfHealth, a commercialisation project that aims to develop a tool for analysing daily life activities using multimodal data from wearable devices, such as smart glasses and smartwatches. This tool will benefit people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, by providing insights into their daily habits and suggesting improvements for better health outcomes.

Outside of research, I am also a digital artist with a passion for animation and concept art. I enjoy exploring visual storytelling and creative expression through illustration and design.

<h2>My name(s)</h2>
<p>
Although I prefer to be called Allie, my Vietnamese name is Duyên, which means "fate" or "destiny".
</p>
<p>
    In Japanese and Chinese, it is written as 緣 (yuán) or 縁 (en). Hence, some might know me as Yukari (ゆかり), which is the Japanese reading of the same character.
