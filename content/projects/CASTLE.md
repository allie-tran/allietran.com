# CASTLE

I was fortunate to be involved in the development of the CASTLE dataset, which is a large-scale, multimodal dataset designed for advancing research in lifelogging, human activity recognition, and multimodal understanding. It provides a rich collection of time-aligned sensor and video data for analysis and benchmarking.

More information about the dataset can be found in the [CASTLE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17116) and the [CASTLE website](https://castle-dataset.github.io/).
