# KatoAI: Empowering Educators with AI-Driven Content Creation and Management

I was fortunate to be part of the team working on [KatoAI](https://kato-ai.com/), an Enterprise Ireland funded commercialisation project that aims to develop a tool for teachers to create, manage and deliver digital content in the classroom.

KatoAI leverages the power of AI to assist educators in generating engaging and interactive learning materials, streamlining lesson planning, and enhancing student engagement. By integrating advanced AI technologies, KatoAI provides a user-friendly platform that simplifies the content creation process, allowing teachers to focus more on teaching and less on administrative tasks.
