A short documentary film, 'The Eternal Memory - The key to the past, the seeds of our future', was created by Diarmuid J Kennedy to accompany this project. It explores the concept of lifelogging and its implications for memory and identity.

The film was selected for the Cannes Short Film Festival, Montreal Independent Film Festival and the Kerry International Film Festival in 2021.
