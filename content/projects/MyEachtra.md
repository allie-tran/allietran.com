MyEachtra (pronounced "My-Och-tra" - Irish for "My Adventure")
is a mobile-first lifelog search engine designed to help users search and explore their personal lifelog data. It is built with a focus on mobile usability, allowing users to access their lifelog information on the go.

Its focus is on event-based search and QA.
